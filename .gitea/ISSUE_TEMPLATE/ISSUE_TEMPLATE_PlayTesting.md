When discovering a bug **always ensure the bug has not already been reported**. Duplicating bugs will simply waste time for the team receiving them.

If this is a new bug:

- set a meaningful title discribing the bug in a very few words and add your team number, eg. `Meaningful title (team A)`
- set the `bug` label
- select the bug report template of the reviewed team
- thoroughly fill in all the fields

If the bug has already been reported:
- carefully read the current bug report
- see if you can contribute to its solution (eg. provide more details on how to reproduce it)
